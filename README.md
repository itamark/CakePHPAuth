# CakePHPAuth

CakePHPAuth is CakePHP + Auth component. It also includes user views (add/login/logout/view/index etc.)
It's based on [CakeStrap from HugoDias](http://www.github.com/hugodias/cakeStrap) - which is a great BootStrap/CakePHP mashup - but some people prefer to start with their own views.
